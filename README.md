# Variable-Diameter-Wheel
An origami-inspired variable diameter wheel that can expand, contract, and roll using a lead screw mechanism, controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. Built for adaptability in robotics, the project demonstrates smart structural transformation through geometric design, with integrated sensors and a display for real-time feedback and monitoring.
